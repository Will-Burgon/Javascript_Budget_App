# Javascript_Budget_App
A nice little app for the browser in which you can keep a little record of income and expenditure. Logic all in Javascript.

An introductory exercise in component based Javascript - keeping different parts of the app separate in order to keep it clean! 
Got to use a lot of the cool aspects of JavaScript here: IIFEs, Closures, Arrays, Objects, Function Contructors.
